    "Investing is about making smart decisions to balance the trade-offs between risk and reward. In this project, we explore portfolio optimization by analyzing financial data from Yahoo Finance. We’ve chosen five asset sectors - Technology, Financials, Healthcare, Communication Services, and Industrials - to build a diversified portfolio. This selection spreads risk across industries while aiming to capture each sector’s growth potential. The list of the stock sectors and the individual stocks can be seen below.\n",

    "Our project focuses on optimizing three models. The first model, also known as the Minimum Volitaty Optimization (MVO), addressing the challenge of balancing variance in addition to diversification by analyzing the performance and relationships between the selected stocks. The second, known as the, Markowitz Model, builds on the baseline by of the variance model by tranforming the model into a trade-off between returns, variance, and diversification, which we believe will give a better result for the allocations. For the third model, we introduce a Sharpe Ratio model, focusing on maximizing the Sharpe Ratio with diversification to evaluate the effeciency of the stock allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio optimization has been a topic of interest for investors and researchers for decades. It’s rooted in the uncertainty of financial markets, where both short-term gains and long-term stability needed careful evaluation. The economist, Harry Markowitz, revolutionized this field in 1952 with his paper Portfolio Selection, introducing diversification as a way to reduce risk (Team Investopedia, 2023). His work laid the groundwork for modern portfolio theory (MPT) and earned him a Nobel Prize. Yet, as markets continue to evolve, ongoing research is critical to adapting strategies for changing conditions like volatility, economic shifts, and new investor behaviors.\n",

    "This report is structured into four sections: the Mathematical Model, where we define the decision variables, constraints, and objective function; the Solution, where we implement the model in Julia; Results and Discussion, where we present and interpret the outcomes; and the Conclusion, summarizing our findings and proposing future directions."

    "While experimenting with initial model, we found out that NVDA overpowers all the other stocks in returns.

While the initial model focused solely on maximizing returns and minimizing risk, this updated formulation includes a diversification penalty factor ($\\gamma$) that penalizes the concentration of portfolio weights.

    "[make changes here]\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensitivity analysis reveals complex interactions between the minimum return requirement (R_min) and risk aversion coefficient (λ). When R_min is low (0.001), the portfolio exhibits high sensitivity to changes in λ, with returns decreasing from 337.68% to 24.15% and risk reducing from 44.15% to 0.06% as λ increases from 1 to 100. This demonstrates the dominant effect of risk aversion when return constraints are not binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as R_min increases, we observe a distinctive \"threshold effect\" where the minimum return constraint becomes binding, limiting the impact of risk aversion. For R_min = 2.0, the portfolio maintains a constant return of 200% and risk of 14.7% when λ ≥ 10, while for R_min = 3.0, the portfolio stabilizes at a 300% return and 34.52% risk when λ ≥ 5. This pattern indicates that higher minimum return requirements effectively constrain the risk-minimization objective, creating a floor for both return and risk levels regardless of further increases in risk aversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings suggest that the effectiveness of risk control through λ adjustment is significantly influenced by the minimum return requirement, with higher R_min values reducing the available risk-return trade-off space. This interaction provides crucial insights for portfolio managers in setting appropriate risk-return targets and understanding their feasible investment options.\n"
